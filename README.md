## Overview

Purrfect is built on the foundation of SnapEnhance, pushing boundaries with innovative features and a refined user experience. This isn't just another fork; it's a complete reimagining of what's possible.

We're committed to active development, bringing you powerful tools that actually matter. Every feature is designed with real users in mind, not just for the sake of adding to a feature list.

<br>

## Philosophy

This project exists because we believe in continuous innovation. We're grateful to the original SnapEnhance team for their groundbreaking work, and we're building on that legacy by exploring new possibilities and listening to what the community actually wants.

No aggressive donation requests. No minimal changes disguised as “major updates.” Just genuine development driven by a passion for creating something exceptional.

## Build from Source

We welcome contributions from developers who share our vision. Whether it's code, documentation, etc., contributions are always appreciated. Feel free to open a PR :)

### 1) Fork

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
```

### 2) Generate a Release Keystore (Certificate)

Create a signing keystore (`.jks`) and keep it secure:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore purrfect-release.keystore \
  -storetype JKS \
  -alias purrfect \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

Optional local placement for Gradle signing:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.android
cp purrfect-release.keystore ~/.android/purrfect-release.keystore
```

### 3) Convert Keystore to Base64

For GitHub Actions secret `PS_BASE_64`:

Linux/macOS:

```bash
base64 -w 0 purrfect-release.keystore > keystore.base64
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("purrfect-release.keystore")) | Set-Content -NoNewline keystore.base64
```

### 4) Add Required GitHub Secrets (Your Fork)

Go to:
`Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret`

Create these exact secrets (from `.github/workflows/release.yml`):

- `PS_BASE_64` = contents of `keystore.base64`
- `PS_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` = `purrfect` (or your chosen alias)
- `PS_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` = key password from `keytool`
- `PS_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` = keystore password from `keytool`

### 5) Run Release Workflow

1. Open `Actions` in your fork.
2. Run `Purrfect Release CI` (`workflow_dispatch`).
3. Workflow builds and signs:
   - `armv8` release APK
   - `armv7` release APK
4. Workflow creates a GitHub Release and uploads APK assets.

### Notes

- CI uses `JDK 21 (Temurin)`.
- Signing requires all four secrets above.
- Keep keystore and passwords private. Rotate immediately if exposed.
